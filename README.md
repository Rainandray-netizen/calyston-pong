# Pong Game

A starter project for a basic pong game using SVGs. Background, logo, and music belong to SEGA's Out Run (1986).

## How To Play
Controls for Player 1: W to move the paddle up, S to move the paddle down.
Controls for Player 2: Up Arrow to move the paddle up, Down Arrow to move the paddle down.
Press spacebar to pause the game.

## Rules
* The first player to reach 5 points gets an increase in their paddle size. 
* If the same player reaches 10 points, they see another increase in their paddle size. 
* If the other player equalizes at 5 points before the first player reaches 10 points, both paddles return to original size. 
* If one player reaches 10 points and then the other player reaches 5 points, the player who reached 5 points will still see an increase in paddle size.
* If the other player then reaches 10 points before the first player wins, both paddles return to original size.
* ### First player to reach 15 points win!

## Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG.

## Personal Learnings

Learnt how to work with SVGs and developed JavaScript skills in order to perform basic animations for the game. Added a retro video game background using CSS and the music from the game using JavaScript to coincide with the retro theme of Pong.

## Deploy

To deploy your finished Pong project as a GitHub page, you must first **update the `predeploy` script in the `package.json` file with the name of your repo.**

For example, if your repo URL is:

https://github.com/bob/pong-project

Update the `predeploy` script as follows:

```json
"predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url /pong-project",
```

Once you have done this, you can run:

`$ npm run deploy`

Now check out your deployed site ðŸ™‚
